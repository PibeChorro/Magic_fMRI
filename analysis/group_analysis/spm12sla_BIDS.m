% Script for the second level analysis of the "Magic" Experiment.
% Idea for study: Dr. Pablo R Grassi in cooperation with Prof. Dr. Andreas
% Bartels in the 'Vision and Cognition Lab' at the University of TÃ¼bingen.
% Development, implementation and execution: Vincent Plikat and Dr. Pablo R
% Grassi in cooperation with Prof. Dr. Adreas Bartels
% Started August 2019 as the Master Thesis of Vincent Plikat
% Data: functional MRI, pupil dilation, gaze position and behavioural
% rating (1-5). In this analysis only the fMRI data will be analyzed.
% Experimental design: The Experiment was divided into 3 blocks. Each block
% consisted of 4 experimental runs. In each run subjects viewed 24 videos
% (each video is considered a trial) of three different categories: Magic
% Control and Surprise. 
% The videos in each block were associated with one object (Balls, Cards
% and Sticks)
% There were 6 Magic videos with 6 coresponding control videos and 3
% surpise videos per block. 3 Different magic effects were used: Object
% appearing, vanishing and color change. The magic and surprise videos were 
% presented twice, the control videos only once. (2*6 magic + 6 control + 2*3
% surpsise = 24 videos). Half of all video presentations were flipped along
% the y-axis and the order of videos was pseudorandomized in a way that the
% same video was never presented in two consecutive trials. 
% The videos were exactly 14 seconds long and followed by a 2 second
% answering phase in which the subject was asked to rate how surprising the
% video's content was. 
% After the second run in each block the underlying methods behind each
% magic trick was presented (during this period we did not measure fMR
% data). Only when every trick was understood the following two runs were
% presented
% --> a 2(pre post revelation)*3(objects)*3(magic effect)*3(video type)
% design.
% In this analysis we analyze the contrasts of the whole video presentation
% first and the contrast of the special moment afterwards.
% In the magic videos the special moment was the moment the
% magical effect happened, in the control videos it was the corresponding 
% moment where one would expect a magic effect to happen and in the
% surprise videos it was the moment the surprising action happened. Those
% moments were selected by Vincent Plikat.
