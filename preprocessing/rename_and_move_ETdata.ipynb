    "# experimental runs. In each run subjects viewed 24 videos (each video is \n",
    "# considered a trial).\n",
    "# The videos in each block were associated with one object (Balls, Cards and \n",
    "# Sticks) and there were 3 magic effects (Appear, Change and Vanish). For each\n",
    "# magic effect and object there are two trick versions (i.e. Appear1, Appear2,\n",
    "# Change1,...). This resulted in 6 magic videos per object = 18 magic videos \n",
    "# and for every magic video there was a corresponding control video showing\n",
